# Welcome to Brandon's GitHub Pages for CSE 110

Hello, my name is Brandon Szeto and I'm interested in the intersection of the fields of computer science and electrical engineering.

An inspiring quote I recently heard was actually *during* CSE 110 lecture:

> Learning will be drip wise to stick - Thomas A. Powell, April 4 2023

One of my favorite command line tricks is

```
echo '* * * * * say $(date)' | crontab
```

If you want your computer to stop announcing the time every minute (day month
year hour minute and timezone), you may want to remove all cron entries by using
the command

```
crontab -r
```

Here is a list of the 10 most used programming languages on my GitHub in
alphabetical order:
- Assembly
- C 
- C++ 
- HTML 
- Lua 
- Rust 
- SystemVerilog
- Shell 
- TeX
- Verilog 

However, as of April 5 2023, their percentage use can be ranked as follows:
1. TeX (19.95%)
2. Assembly (18.02%)
3. Verilog (12.57%)
4. C (12.27%)
5. SystemVerilog (12.20%)
6. C++ (11.01%)
7. Rust (6.14%)
8. Lua (3.08%)
9. Shell (2.86%)
10. HTML (1.90%)

Some of my goals for the year of 2023 include:
- [x] Consistently commit to GitHub
- [x] Better organize my time
- [x] Perform well in class
- [x] Consistenly practice a new language
- [ ] Eat healthy
- [ ] Bench 225
- [ ] Work on new projects

Deliverables can be found:
